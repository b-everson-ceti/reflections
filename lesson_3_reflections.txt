-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working as part of a team and the deployment version isn't on your local machine. If you want to have a backup of code. 
When you are contributing to someone's github project.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This would serve as a reminder that you are overwriting files in your working branch. 

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are a copy of a github repository from one github account to another. Clones are when you copy a repository from one machine 
to another. A branch is when you create a new space of history to develop separately from your main development history. Forks are 
used when you want to have your own copy of someone's project on github. Clones are when you want to make a copy of a project on your 
local machine that will be related to the copy on the other machine. Branches are used to create a different version of a piece of 
software or when you want to experiment with changes.

-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It would mean fewer merges if you keep it up to date. You would have to write or design more changes if you aren't basing changes off of the 
current version.
