-Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

With changes to code you might be effecting multiple files, which would mean you would need to commit them all
together. This is not the case for google docs because the documents most likely wouldn't depend on eachother 
and require related changes to both.

-How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You can use git log to get the hash number of the commit, which can be used in a diff to find the changes made
during that commit.

-How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

With version control in place you could narrow down errors to certain commits. Also, if you do break something 
you can just go back to it. 

-Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use git in order to be able to make changes to the codebase in an environment that will protect the 
current working version. It will also help with tracking down bugs newly created.
