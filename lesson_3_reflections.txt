-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working as part of a team and the deployment version isn't on your local machine. If you want to have a backup of code. 
When you are contributing to someone's github project.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This would serve as a reminder that you are overwriting files in your working branch.
