-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create the hidden folder needed by git to store different versions. The files and 
folders used by git aren't in place so there is no start for the project.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is the location on disk, so the staging area is in memory and 
it also hasn't been commited to the repository. It allows you to ensure that you have 
the right files "staged" before you commit them.
